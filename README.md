This Python Jupyter Notebook contains the process that I went though to explore, and then clean, the dataset of bird observations in NC in the Spring of 2023 used for my Data Analyst Portfolio Project.
The data was provided by the Cornell Labs public e-birds database.
While I would have loved to work with the full dataset for the entire US over the last 2-3 years the dataset was just too large for my current hardware or Tableau Public, so I opted to filter it down to just the spring of 2023 and
North Carolina, as that is where I lived at the time.
